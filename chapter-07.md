# Chapter 7: Yes

After Owen left, I sat in the library corner for ten full minutes, staring at nothing.

I'd said yes.

To Owen Riley. To breaking curfew. To deliberately violating the rules I'd upheld for three years, not in an impulsive moment but as a planned, conscious choice.

What was I doing?

I pulled out my planner, flipping to Friday. The day was already filled with color-coded commitments—classes, student council meeting, library hours, thesis work. A perfectly organized day that would carry me through to evening study hours, then bedtime routine, then lights out at 9:45 as always.

Except now, Friday at 11:00 PM, there was something new. I couldn't write it down, couldn't risk Sarah seeing, but it was there anyway. An unmarked commitment that would require me to lie to my best friend, sneak out of my dorm, and trust Owen Riley to keep me safe while violating every principle I'd built my Fairmont identity around.

I should cancel. The smart choice was obvious—find Owen tomorrow, tell him I'd reconsidered, apologize for wasting his time. Get back to my normal life and pretend this entire week had never happened.

My hand moved to close the planner.

I left it open instead, staring at Friday's schedule, imagining what I couldn't write. Where Owen would take me. What Fairmont looked like after everyone else was safely asleep. What it felt like to move through campus knowing I wasn't supposed to be there.

The library clock showed 4:35. My thesis meeting had started five minutes ago.

I shoved my planner into my bag and hurried downstairs, arriving at Mrs. Peterson's office breathless and apologetic. She waved off my apology and dove into discussing my thesis proposal, but I could barely focus. My mind kept drifting back to Owen's question.

Have you ever broken a rule?

And my answer: No. Never. Not before Tuesday night.

What kind of person went seventeen years without breaking a single rule? Not rebellious ones, sure. But also not curious ones, adventurous ones, ones who questioned whether all rules deserved to be followed.

Safe ones, I realized. People who'd decided survival was enough.

"Charlotte?" Mrs. Peterson's voice pulled me back. "You seem distracted lately. Is everything all right?"

"Fine," I said automatically. "Just stressed about applications."

It was becoming my default excuse, and I hated how easily the lie came. First Mr. Hartwell, then Sarah, now Mrs. Peterson. I'd spent three years being honest, and one week with Owen Riley had turned me into someone who lied constantly.

Except I'd been lying before, hadn't I? Lying by omission every time someone assumed I was happy with my perfectly planned life and I didn't correct them. Lying by performance every time I showed up early and prepared and focused when inside I felt like I was slowly disappearing.

The meeting finally ended. I gathered my things and headed to the dining hall for dinner, still processing the afternoon's conversation. Still trying to understand why I'd said yes when every logical part of me knew I should have said no.

Sarah was already at our table when I arrived, saving me a seat. I slid in beside her, grateful for the familiar routine even as guilt gnawed at me.

"Better today?" she asked. "You seemed really out of it at lunch."

"A little," I hedged. "Still tired."

"You need to sleep more. You can't run on empty all semester." Sarah passed me the bread basket. "Maybe skip tonight's study hours? Just go to bed early?"

The suggestion was perfectly reasonable. I did need sleep. I should take care of myself, maintain the stamina required for my demanding schedule.

But the thought of lying in bed with nothing to distract me from Friday's approaching deadline made my stomach clench.

"I'll try," I said, which wasn't a promise.

Dinner conversation flowed around me—Sarah discussing her biology lab, James explaining some new formal planning crisis, others debating the merits of various colleges. Normal Wednesday evening talk that I usually engaged in easily.

Tonight I just felt separate from it all, like I was watching from outside, observing people who lived completely within Fairmont's structure while I'd somehow stepped half a foot beyond it.

Owen sat three tables away with David and some theater students. He didn't look my direction, didn't acknowledge me, but I was aware of him anyway. Aware that we shared a secret now, a plan that neither of us had written down but both knew.

Friday at eleven.

After dinner I went through my evening routine mechanically. Study hours in the library, where I read the same page of "The Great Gatsby" four times without absorbing a word. Return to the dorm at 9:30, change into pajamas, organize tomorrow's schedule.

Sarah was already in bed, reading for English class. She looked up when I sat at my desk.

"Can I ask you something?" she said.

My heart jumped. "Sure."

"Are you..." She hesitated. "Are you okay? Really?"

"I'm fine. Why?"

"Because you've been weird all week. Distracted, tired, jumpy. And at lunch today when Owen Riley came to our table, you looked like you'd seen a ghost." Sarah set her book down. "What's going on?"

I could tell her. Should tell her, maybe. Sarah was my best friend, the person I'd trusted for three years. But how could I explain something I didn't understand myself?

"It's nothing," I said. "Just stressed about college applications. Early decision deadline is coming up, and I'm second-guessing my Wellesley essay."

Another lie. They were coming easier now, which terrified me.

"You want help with it?" Sarah offered. "I'm good at proofreading."

"No, it's okay. I just need to work through it myself."

Sarah watched me for another moment, then picked up her book. "Okay. But Charlotte? If something was wrong, you'd tell me, right?"

"Of course," I lied.

We settled into evening quiet, Sarah reading while I pretended to review notes. At exactly 9:45, I turned off my desk lamp and climbed into bed. Through our window, I could see the bell tower, its clock showing 9:47.

In the darkness, I listened to Sarah's breathing slow into sleep. Wondered if this was what Friday would be like—lying here waiting for the right moment to slip out, heart pounding, knowing I was about to cross a line I couldn't uncross.

Thursday passed in a blur of nervous energy.

I went through my classes, contributed to student council meetings, worked on my thesis proposal. On the surface, everything was normal. But underneath, I was counting down.

Thirty-six hours until eleven o'clock Friday night.

Twenty-four hours.

Twelve hours.

I barely slept Thursday night. Kept checking the clock—10:47, 11:23, 12:41, 2:15. Each time thinking: Tomorrow at this time, I'll be out there. Breaking curfew. Seeing Fairmont the way Owen sees it.

By Friday morning, I was running on adrenaline and coffee. James commented on the dark circles under my eyes at our council meeting. Sarah offered her biology notes because she assumed I'd been up all night studying. Mr. Hartwell asked if I was feeling all right when I stared out the window during his entire lecture on post-war conformity.

I'm fine, I told everyone. Just tired. Just stressed. Just normal Charlotte Pierce dealing with normal senior year pressure.

Another lie. Another performance.

By Friday evening, I was wound so tight I thought I might snap.

Dinner was torture—food I couldn't taste, conversation I couldn't follow, Sarah watching me with increasing concern. I made an excuse about a headache and returned to the dorm early, which gave me two hours to sit in our room and alternate between excitement and terror.

I should cancel. Still time to cancel. Find Owen, tell him I couldn't do this, go to bed at 9:45 like always.

But I knew I wouldn't.

Because some part of me—the part that had been slowly waking up all week—was desperate to know what existed beyond my carefully maintained structure. Desperate to feel that same aliveness I'd felt Tuesday night when I'd lied for Owen and he'd caught my wrist and asked me why.

At 9:30, Sarah came back from evening study hours. We went through our routine—change into pajamas, wash faces, set out tomorrow's clothes. Normal. Everything perfectly normal.

At 9:45, I turned off my light and climbed into bed.

"Night," Sarah murmured, already half-asleep.

"Night," I whispered back.

I lay there in the dark, listening to Sarah's breathing slow and even out. Watching the clock on my desk tick forward. 10:00. 10:15. 10:30.

My heart was pounding so hard I was certain Sarah could hear it.

10:45.

Sarah's breathing stayed deep and regular. She was fully asleep, wouldn't wake unless I made significant noise.

I sat up slowly, carefully. Waited. Sarah didn't stir.

10:50.

I slipped out of bed, already dressed in dark jeans and a sweater I'd hidden under my pajamas. Found my shoes by the door, my cardigan on the desk chair. Moved through our room like a ghost, testing every floorboard for creaks.

Sarah slept on.

I opened our door with aching slowness, slipped into the hallway, closed it behind me without a sound. The third-floor hallway was empty, silent except for muffled sounds behind closed doors—music, conversations, the ordinary evening of students safely in their rooms.

The common room's window was at the far end of the hall. Owen had said it didn't lock properly. I'd never noticed, never had reason to check.

But when I tried it, the window slid open easily, revealing the fire escape beyond.

Ten minutes until eleven.

I climbed through the window, onto the metal platform, and looked down at campus spread below me. Dark pathways, lit windows, the bell tower rising against the night sky.

Somewhere out there, Owen was waiting.

I started climbing down, each step taking me further from safety and deeper into choice.

My planner sat on my desk upstairs, color-coded and perfectly organized. Friday's schedule carefully planned and executed.

Except for eleven o'clock.

Except for this.

I reached the ground and started walking toward the chapel, toward the maintenance door, toward Owen and whatever came next.

My hands were shaking.

My heart was racing.

And I had never felt more awake in my entire life.
