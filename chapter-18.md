# Chapter 18: Help That Hurts

The week after family weekend, I felt like I was living underwater. Everything muffled, movements slow, pressure constant.

Owen had stopped approaching me directly after our library confrontation. I'd see him across the dining hall, and he'd nod but keep his distance. Respecting my boundaries.

Which somehow made me feel worse.

Part of me wanted him to push, wanted someone to tell me what to do next. I'd spent so long following directions that navigating my own path felt impossible.

Wednesday afternoon, I sat in the honor society meeting room, staring at the agenda Mr. Patterson had distributed. Discussion items about spring fundraising and community service requirements blurred together into meaningless words.

"Charlotte?" Mr. Patterson's voice pulled me back. "Your thoughts on the proposed tutoring expansion?"

I opened my mouth to give my usual detailed response—the kind that made teachers write "excellent leadership potential" in recommendation letters.

Instead, I heard myself say, "I need to leave early today. I'm sorry."

The room went quiet. I never left early. I never missed meetings.

"Is everything all right?" Mr. Patterson asked, concern creasing his forehead.

"Yes. I just—I have to go."

I grabbed my bag and walked out, leaving a room full of confused honor society members behind me.

My phone buzzed as I reached the quad. A text from Owen: *Saw you leave Prescott. You ok?*

He'd been watching. Still paying attention even while giving me space.

I typed back: *Need to talk. Bell tower?*

His response came immediately: *Daylight visit or proper one?*

Despite everything, I smiled slightly. *Daylight. Meet you there in 10.*

Owen was already waiting when I climbed the tower stairs, sitting on the platform with his back against the railing. December wind whipped across the open space.

"Hey," he said as I emerged. "What's going on?"

I sat beside him, pulling my jacket tighter. "I just walked out of honor society."

"Walked out as in left early or quit?"

"Left early. But I think I might want to quit."

Owen studied me carefully. "Why?"

"Because I don't care about spring fundraising or community service requirements. I've been sitting in those meetings for two years saying things I'm supposed to say." I met his eyes. "I'm so tired of supposed to."

"Then quit."

I laughed, sharp and bitter. "It's not that simple."

"Why not?"

"Because it's on my applications. Because it looks good. Because the counselor said commitment to service organizations is important for competitive schools."

"So you're going to keep doing something you hate because it looks good on paper?"

I wanted to argue, but the truth was too obvious. "Yes. Probably."

Owen shook his head. "Charlotte, that's exactly what I've been trying to—" He stopped himself. "Sorry. Not pushing. You get to make your own choices."

"But you think I'm making the wrong ones."

"I think you're making choices based on what other people value instead of what you value. Which is different from wrong—it's just sad."

The wind picked up, making my eyes water. Or maybe that wasn't the wind.

"What if I don't know what I value?" The words came out quiet, almost lost in the sound of wind and distant ocean. "What if I've been following everyone else's directions for so long that I don't have a compass of my own?"

Owen shifted closer, not touching but present. "Then maybe you start figuring it out. Small things at first."

"Like quitting honor society?"

"Like asking yourself what you actually want to do with your time. And then doing that, even if it doesn't look good on applications."

I thought about the hours I'd spent in meetings I didn't care about, building a résumé that represented nothing authentic about who I was.

"I don't want to go to Wellesley," I said suddenly. "My mother went there and loved it. But I don't think I want a women's college. I don't think I want pre-law. I don't know what I want instead, but I know I don't want that."

"Then tell your college counselor."

"And say what? That I've changed my mind about my entire future but have no alternative plan?"

"Yes."

I stared at him. "That makes me look completely indecisive and unstable."

"Or it makes you look like someone who's thinking critically about your own life instead of following a script." Owen leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Charlotte, you're so worried about how things look that you've stopped caring about how they feel. That's not sustainable."

He was right. I hated that he was right.

"I should go to the college counselor," I said. "Tell her I want to reconsider my application strategy."

Owen smiled. "That sounds like your own decision."

Mrs. Winters's office smelled like coffee and paper. She looked up when I knocked, surprise crossing her face.

"Charlotte! I don't have you down for an appointment."

"I know. I'm sorry to drop in. But I wanted to talk about my applications."

"Of course. Sit down." She closed her laptop. "What's on your mind?"

I sat across from her desk, where I'd confidently outlined my Wellesley strategy in September. That Charlotte felt like a stranger now.

"I'm reconsidering Wellesley," I said. "And pre-law. I need to look at other options."

Mrs. Winters's eyebrows rose slightly. "That's quite a shift. In September you were certain about Wellesley. What changed?"

"I think I was choosing what felt safe instead of what felt right."

"I see." Mrs. Winters pulled out my file. "It's not too late to adjust your list. But this kind of uncertainty concerns me. Colleges want students with clear direction. If your applications seem unfocused, that can hurt your chances."

"I understand."

"Do you have any sense of what you want to pursue instead?"

"I don't know yet," I admitted. "I need time to figure it out."

Her expression shifted to worry. "Charlotte, you've been one of my most decisive students. Seeing you suddenly uncertain—is everything okay? Is something affecting your focus?"

I could almost hear Owen's voice: *Tell her the truth. Say you're discovering what you actually want.*

But sitting in Mrs. Winters's office, surrounded by college pennants and acceptance statistics, the truth felt impossible. Because in this room, uncertainty was weakness. Questions without answers were liabilities.

"Everything's fine," I heard myself say. "I'm just keeping my options open."

"I'd encourage you to narrow those options quickly. You need a coherent narrative." She made a note in my file. "Take some time this week to reflect. Then we can meet next week with clearer direction."

"Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Winters."

I left her office feeling worse than when I'd entered.

Owen found me afterward, sitting on the library steps despite the December cold.

"How'd it go?" he asked, sitting beside me.

"Terribly. She thinks I'm having some kind of breakdown. Like the only explanation for changing my mind is that something's wrong with me."

"Maybe she's right."

I shot him a look. "Not helping."

"No, I mean—maybe something is wrong. Not with you, but with a system that treats uncertainty as failure." Owen pulled his jacket tighter. "You're seventeen. You're supposed to be figuring things out."

"Tell that to colleges."

"Colleges accept plenty of undecided students."

"Not the competitive ones. Not when you're competing against students like my brother who've known they wanted to be lawyers since they were fifteen."

Owen was quiet for a moment. "Do you think your brother actually wanted to be a lawyer at fifteen? Or did he just figure out early how to say what everyone wanted to hear?"

I'd never thought about it that way. My brother had always seemed so certain, so directed. The perfect example of focused ambition.

But maybe he'd just been better at performing certainty than I was.

"I don't know," I said finally. "But it doesn't matter. This is my life, not his."

"Exactly."

My phone buzzed. A text from Sarah: *Honor society meeting ended. Everyone asking where you went. You okay?*

I showed Owen the message. "I'm going to have to explain this."

"So explain it. Say you had somewhere else you needed to be."

"They'll want to know where."

"Then tell them it's personal."

I stared at my phone, at Sarah's concerned message, at the weight of explanation and justification that came with every deviation from expected behavior.

"I'm so tired," I said quietly. "I'm tired of performing and explaining and justifying every choice I make. I just want to make a decision without having to defend it to five different people."

"Then don't defend it. Just make the choice and let that be enough."

"That's not how my life works."

"Maybe it should be."

I turned to face him. "You make it sound so easy. Just stop caring what people think. Just do what you want. But I've spent seventeen years building relationships and trust and reputation, and throwing that away because I suddenly decided I want to be authentic—that's not brave, Owen. That's selfish."

"Is it?" His voice was gentle but challenging. "Or is maintaining relationships built on performance actually more selfish than being honest?"

I wanted to argue, but couldn't. Because somewhere deep down, I knew he was right.

The Charlotte my parents loved was a performance. The student council member James respected was a careful construction. The honor society vice president Mr. Patterson relied on was built to meet external expectations.

And maintaining all those performances was exhausting.

"I don't know how to stop," I said finally. "I don't know how to just be myself without being terrified that myself isn't good enough."

Owen reached over and took my hand. The gesture was simple, casual, but it felt like an anchor.

"You're already good enough," he said. "The person who questions rules and admits when she's uncertain—that Charlotte is more interesting than any perfect version you could perform."

I wanted to believe him. Wanted it so badly it hurt.

But seventeen years of expectations didn't disappear just because someone said I was good enough.

"I should get back," I said, standing up. "Sarah's probably worried."

Owen stood too, still holding my hand. "For what it's worth—I think walking out of that meeting today was brave."

"It felt like running away."

"Sometimes running away from the wrong thing is the first step toward the right thing."

I squeezed his hand once, then let go. "Thanks, Owen."

I walked back toward Whitmore Hall as evening settled over campus. My phone kept buzzing—Sarah asking if I was okay, Mr. Patterson checking in, James asking about student council.

Everyone wanting to know where I was, what I was doing, if I was all right.

Everyone except Owen, who'd asked what I wanted and believed my answer.

That difference felt enormous.
