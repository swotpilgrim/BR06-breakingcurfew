# Chapter 17: Overheard

Owen's parents had taken him to Portland Sunday morning for brunch—the kind of relaxed meal where nobody checked their phone or mentioned grades. He'd told them about Charlotte, carefully editing the midnight meetings but keeping the truth: he'd met someone who was discovering what it meant to question systems she'd always obeyed.

His mother had smiled knowingly. His father had asked what Charlotte was reading.

Driving back through the gray December afternoon, Owen felt the contrast between his family and Fairmont's formality like whiplash. He wondered which version of family Charlotte had experienced this weekend.

The answer appeared before he even reached his dorm.

From across the quad, he spotted Charlotte with her parents outside the administration building. He started to raise his hand in greeting, but something about her posture stopped him.

She stood very still, very straight, arms at her sides. Not the way she climbed to the bell tower. Smaller somehow, like she was trying to take up less space.

Owen moved to a bench near the library entrance—close enough to see, far enough to avoid intruding.

Charlotte's mother stood ramrod straight in an expensive wool coat, pearls visible at her throat even from this distance. Her father wore a dark suit that screamed corporate attorney. They looked like they'd stepped out of a Fairmont promotional brochure—exactly the kind of polished, successful parents the school loved to showcase.

And they were eviscerating their daughter with surgical precision.

Owen couldn't hear the words at first, but he saw Charlotte nod at something her mother said, saw her shoulders hunch slightly. He moved closer without thinking, drawn by the wrongness of seeing confident, questioning Charlotte reduced to this quiet, agreeable stranger.

"—no slip-ups through spring, Charlotte." Her mother's voice carried across the cold air, sharp and clear. "No distractions that could jeopardize your application. You've worked too hard to let your focus waver now."

"I know, Mom." Charlotte's voice was barely audible. Nothing like the voice that debated philosophy in Mr. Hartwell's class or asked him difficult questions in the bell tower.

"Your brother's perfect transcript was key to his Yale admission," her father added. His tone was measured, factual, devastating. "The committee specifically mentioned his consistency. They want to see students who maintain standards, not ones who show concerning patterns of decline."

"It was one A-minus in chemistry," Charlotte said quietly.

"Which is why we're addressing it now." Her mother's hand touched Charlotte's shoulder—not affectionate, corrective. "Details matter, darling. Everything matters at this stage."

Owen stopped breathing. He'd known Charlotte came from pressure, but hearing it laid out like this, watching her parents reduce her to grades and applications, made something hot and angry coil in his chest.

"We've already discussed this with the headmaster," her father continued, checking his watch. "He's aware we expect Charlotte to finish the year as strongly as she started. No distractions, no unnecessary extracurriculars beyond what benefits her applications."

"We're not being harsh, Charlotte." Her mother's voice softened slightly, which somehow made it worse. "We're being realistic. You're competing against students who maintain perfect records. Students like your brother. We know you're capable of that standard—you've proven it for three years. We simply need you to remember what's at stake."

Charlotte nodded. Just nodded, like she was agreeing to terms in a contract.

Owen felt sick.

This wasn't parental concern. This was systematic dismantling of anything that didn't serve a predetermined outcome. Charlotte wasn't their daughter in this moment—she was a project they'd invested in, and they were protecting their investment.

"We should go." Her father gestured toward the parking lot where a silver Mercedes waited. "Traffic back to Connecticut will be heavy if we wait much longer."

"Remember what we discussed about Wellesley," her mother added. "Finalize that application over winter break. Early decision demonstrates commitment."

"I will."

"And consider James's invitation to the spring formal. The Whitmore family has excellent connections, and a relationship with someone who shares your values would be..." Her mother paused, selecting her words carefully. "Beneficial. Stable."

Owen's hands clenched into fists. They were arranging her social life now. Planning out relationships based on networking value.

"I'll think about it," Charlotte said. Still quiet. Still agreeable.

Her parents offered perfunctory hugs—her mother kissing the air near Charlotte's cheek, her father's arm briefly around her shoulders. Then they walked toward their Mercedes.

Owen watched Charlotte's shoulders drop the moment they turned away. Her whole body sagged like a puppet with cut strings. She stood there, staring at nothing, exhaustion in every line of her frame.

This was what she'd been hiding behind perfect grades and student council positions. Not just pressure to achieve, but systematic erasure of anything that didn't fit her parents' blueprint for success.

The girl who questioned authority, who climbed bell towers after curfew, who asked difficult questions about systems and rules—her parents had no idea that person existed. They saw only the perfect daughter performing exactly as trained.

And Charlotte let them. Because she'd learned that was the only version they wanted.

Owen understood then. Charlotte's rule-following wasn't natural—it was survival. She'd built her identity around external validation because that was the only version of herself her family acknowledged.

Breaking curfew to meet him hadn't been rebellion. It had been the first time she'd chosen something for herself instead of performing for approval.

He wanted to go to her, but the way she stood there, so clearly drained—he recognized she needed space, not rescue.

Charlotte finally moved, walking toward Whitmore Hall with slow steps. Owen let her go, staying on his bench as December cold seeped through his jacket.

He'd thought he understood what Charlotte was working through—questioning rules, discovering independence. But it was deeper. She was learning that she existed beyond other people's expectations. That her parents' approval wasn't worth erasing herself.

And that was terrifying in ways Owen had never experienced.

His parents had raised him to question everything, encouraged his independence, supported his choices. He'd never had to choose between being himself and being loved.

Charlotte had lived seventeen years where those two things were mutually exclusive.

---

He found her later that evening in the library, tucked into a study carrel on the second floor. She had her chemistry textbook open but wasn't reading—just staring at the same page, one finger tracing the same diagram over and over.

Owen approached carefully. "Hey."

She looked up, and for a moment she was somewhere else entirely. Then recognition clicked in. "Hey. How was Portland?"

"Good. My parents say hi even though they've never met you." He gestured to the empty chair. "Can I sit?"

She nodded, closing her textbook. "How did they know about me?"

"I told them I met someone interesting. Someone who's asking questions I'd never thought about." He studied her face—she looked exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with staying up late. "How was your weekend?"

"Fine." The word came automatically, practiced. "My parents visited. Family weekend."

"I saw them. Outside administration this morning when I got back."

Something flickered in her expression. Wariness, maybe. "Oh."

"I didn't mean to eavesdrop," Owen said carefully. "But I heard some of what they said. About your grades. About your brother."

Charlotte's face went very still. "It's not—they're just worried about my applications. It's normal parent stuff."

"Charlotte." He kept his voice gentle. "Is it?"

She looked away, jaw tight. "You don't understand. They have high expectations, but that's because they believe in me. Because they know what I'm capable of."

"Do they know what you actually want? Or just what they've decided you should want?"

"That's not fair." Her voice sharpened. "You have parents who let you do whatever you want. Who think questioning authority is some noble philosophical exercise. Not everyone has that luxury."

"I'm not criticizing your parents," Owen said, though part of him absolutely was. "I'm just—seeing how you were with them, how different you looked—"

"How I looked?" Charlotte stood abruptly, shoving her textbook into her bag. "You were watching me with my parents? That's—" She stopped, pressing her lips together. "I need to go."

"Wait, I didn't mean—"

"I know what you meant." She faced him, eyes bright with something between anger and tears. "You meant that I'm trapped. That I'm some victim who needs rescuing from her terrible parents. That everything I've worked for my entire life is just me following orders instead of making real choices."

"That's not what I said."

"But it's what you think." She hugged her bag to her chest like armor. "And maybe you're right. Maybe I don't know the difference between what I want and what I've been told to want. But that doesn't mean you get to feel sorry for me or try to fix me."

Owen stood too, frustrated. "I don't want to fix you. I just hate seeing you make yourself smaller for people who don't even see you."

"They're my parents, Owen. They love me."

"Do they love you, or do they love the perfect daughter you perform for them?"

The words hung between them, brutal and honest.

Charlotte's expression crumpled for just a second before she locked it down. "I'm going back to my dorm."

"Charlotte—"

"I'm fine." She turned and walked away, back straight, shoulders squared. Performing control even in retreat.

Owen watched her go and wondered if he'd just made everything worse.

He'd wanted her to see that her parents' expectations weren't the only valid measure of success. That she could choose differently. But pushing her to recognize that her family loved a version of her that didn't fully exist—that was cruel, no matter how true.

And Charlotte wasn't ready to hear it. Maybe wouldn't ever be ready.

He sat back down at the study carrel, staring at the empty chair where she'd been sitting. The chemistry textbook diagram she'd been tracing was about molecular bonds—the way atoms held together through attractive forces even when it might be energetically favorable to break apart.

Owen thought about Charlotte, bound to her parents' expectations by seventeen years of conditioning. Thought about how breaking free might feel like breaking herself.

And he realized that caring about someone meant respecting their pace, not forcing revelations they weren't ready for.

He'd screwed that up tonight. Badly.

Owen pulled out his phone, then put it away. A text wouldn't fix this. Charlotte needed space to process, to decide for herself what she believed about her parents and their expectations and the person she was becoming.

All he could do was wait and hope she'd let him back in when she was ready.

If she ever was.
