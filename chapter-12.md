# Chapter 12: Questions

Student council meeting, mid-November. James presenting yet another proposal to increase structure and enforcement.

"The bell tower should be locked," he said, showing architectural diagrams. "Students have no legitimate reason to access it, and leaving it open is a security risk."

My stomach dropped. The bell tower—where Owen had first shown me Fairmont from a different perspective. Where we'd kissed. Where I'd felt most myself.

"What security risk?" I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral.

"Unauthorized access. Students going where they shouldn't." James tapped the diagram. "Maintenance reports the upper door lock is loose. Anyone could get in."

Anyone. Meaning people like Owen and me.

"Has there been any actual security incident?" I pressed. "Any evidence of students misusing the tower?"

"The point is prevention, not reaction," James said. "Why wait for a problem when we can prevent it?"

"Because preventing a hypothetical problem with a restrictive solution affects everyone." I was aware of the table watching us, this familiar tension between James and me. "The bell tower's observation deck offers the best view of campus. Photography students use it. Astronomy club. Should we restrict everyone because some students might hypothetically misuse it?"

"It's after-hours access I'm concerned about," James clarified. "During the day, supervised access would still be allowed."

"So it's about curfew enforcement." I met his eyes. "About controlling where students can be and when, not about actual safety."

James's jaw tightened. "It's about maintaining appropriate boundaries."

"Appropriate according to who?"

The question hung in the air. Sarah was watching me with concern. Other council members looked uncomfortable with the confrontation.

"According to Fairmont's administration," James said finally. "According to the rules we're supposed to uphold."

"We're supposed to represent students," I countered. "That means questioning whether rules serve students or just serve control."

James stood abruptly. "I'll submit the proposal to Dr. Ashford directly. This council is supposed to support institutional standards, not undermine them."

He left the meeting early. In the silence after, Sarah leaned toward me.

"That was intense," she whispered.

"He wants to lock the tower," I said, still processing. "Cut off access to one of the few places on campus where you can actually see beyond Fairmont's walls."

"Is this about the tower," Sarah asked carefully, "or is this about something else?"

I didn't answer. Couldn't tell her about midnight adventures, about Owen, about the person I was becoming. Not yet.

But Sarah was too perceptive for easy deflection. After the meeting, she pulled me aside.

"Okay, what's going on with you?"

"What do you mean?"

"Don't." Sarah crossed her arms. "You've been different all semester. Distracted, secretive, challenging James constantly. Missing scheduled library hours, showing up late to things, sitting with Owen Riley at lunch." She paused. "And I know you've been sneaking out."

My heart stopped. "What?"

"Some nights I wake up and you're not in your bed. You come back around one AM, thinking I'm asleep, but I'm not always." Sarah's expression was more concerned than angry. "Where are you going, Charlotte?"

I could lie. Should lie, probably. But I was so tired of lying to my best friend.

"I can't tell you," I said quietly. "Not because I don't trust you, but because telling you puts you in a position where you'd have to choose between covering for me and reporting me. I won't do that to you."

Sarah processed this. "Is it dangerous? Are you safe?"

"I'm safe. I promise."

"Is it Owen?"

I didn't answer, which was answer enough.

Sarah sighed. "Charlotte, I've known you for three years. You've never broken a rule, never taken a risk, never done anything that could jeopardize your record. And now suddenly you're..." She gestured helplessly. "I'm worried about you. I'm worried you're going to throw away everything you've worked for."

"What if everything I've worked for isn't what I actually want?" The words came out sharper than intended. "What if I've spent three years building a perfect record for a future I don't even want?"

"So you're throwing it all away?"

"I'm questioning whether it deserves to be thrown away," I corrected. "That's different."

Sarah looked at me for a long moment. "Just... be careful, okay? Whatever you're doing, whoever you're doing it with—don't lose yourself in the process."

"I'm not losing myself," I said. "I'm finding myself. That's the point."

But later, sitting in Mr. Hartwell's class listening to a discussion about institutional versus individual authority, I wondered if Sarah was right to worry.

Mr. Hartwell posed a question to the class. "When is it appropriate to break unjust rules versus working within systems to change them?"

James answered immediately. "You work within systems. Breaking rules just creates chaos. Real change comes through proper channels."

"Always?" Mr. Hartwell prompted. "What about the Civil Rights movement? Sit-ins and protests were rule-breaking."

"That was different. Those were genuinely unjust laws."

"And who decides which laws are genuinely unjust?" Mr. Hartwell asked.

Owen spoke from the back. "The people subject to them. Authority isn't automatically legitimate just because it exists. Sometimes breaking rules is the only way to demonstrate they shouldn't exist."

"So any rule you disagree with, you should break?" James challenged.

"I didn't say that." Owen's voice was calm, thoughtful. "I said sometimes rule-breaking is necessary. But I also think some structure is helpful—the question is whether specific rules serve people or just serve power."

I blinked. Owen acknowledging that some structure could be helpful? That was new.

Mr. Hartwell looked pleased. "So we're distinguishing between rules that genuinely serve community welfare and rules that simply enforce control. How do we tell the difference?"

I raised my hand. "By asking who benefits. If a rule protects people's safety or enables functioning community, it probably serves a purpose. If it just restricts behavior that doesn't actually harm anyone, it's probably about control."

"Good," Mr. Hartwell said. "Apply that framework to Fairmont. Which rules serve genuine purposes and which are just control mechanisms?"

The discussion that followed was the most engaged I'd seen our class. Students debating curfew policies, dress codes, academic requirements. James defending every institutional rule. Owen questioning most of them. Me somewhere in between, recognizing that some structure helped while also seeing how much of Fairmont's control was arbitrary.

After class, Owen caught up with me in the hallway.

"That was interesting," he said. "You're developing a nuanced position."

"So are you. Since when do you admit that some structure is helpful?"

Owen smiled ruefully. "Since watching you navigate questioning your assumptions. Made me realize I have my own rigid beliefs—just in the opposite direction from James. Anti-establishment can be just as dogmatic as pro-establishment if you're not careful."

"So we're both learning."

"Apparently." He glanced around the busy hallway, then lowered his voice. "Boathouse tonight? Eleven thirty?"

My heart jumped. "I'll be there."

The boathouse sat on the edge of Fairmont's property, where campus met water. Inside, old crew shells hung overhead, the smell of lake water and wood permeating everything.

Owen had brought a flashlight, blanket. We sat side by side on the floor, backs against the wall, listening to water lap against the dock outside.

"I heard about James's bell tower proposal," Owen said.

"How?"

"David sits on facilities committee. They're discussing it." Owen was quiet for a moment. "If they lock it, we lose one of the best access points."

"There are other places," I said.

"True. But that tower..." Owen trailed off. "That's where you first saw Fairmont differently. Where I first saw you seeing it differently. It matters."

"It does," I agreed.

We sat in comfortable silence, shoulders touching. Through the window, moonlight reflected off water in silver ripples.

"Can I ask you something?" Owen said finally.

"Always."

"Do you regret it? Any of this?" He gestured vaguely at the boathouse, at us. "You've changed so much in two months. Questioned everything you believed, challenged your best friend and student council president. You're risking your perfect record for midnight adventures with the school rebel." He looked at me. "Do you ever wish you'd just walked past me that night? Kept your structure, stayed safe?"

I thought about it honestly. About who I'd been in September—rigid, scheduled, performing perfection without questioning if it made me happy. About who I was becoming—messier, less certain, but more real.

"No," I said firmly. "I don't regret any of it."

Owen's expression shifted—relief mixed with something deeper. He reached for my hand, threading his fingers through mine.

"Good," he said quietly. "Because I'd regret losing this. Losing you."

The admission hung between us, weighted with meaning. We were past midnight adventures now. Past philosophical discussions and shared secrets. This was something else—something neither of us had planned but both of us were choosing.

I turned toward him, and Owen turned toward me. The space between us shrank. His hand came up to cup my face, thumb brushing my cheekbone like he had at the tower.

"Charlotte," he whispered.

I leaned in, closing the distance—

Voices outside. Faculty patrol, close and getting closer.

We froze. Owen's eyes met mine in the flashlight's dim glow—frustration and humor mixed.

"Hide," he mouthed.

We scrambled behind the hanging crew shells, pressed into the corner, barely breathing. The boathouse door rattled—locked, thankfully. Footsteps circled the building.

"Probably just wind," a voice said. Mr. Hartwell's voice.

"Should we check inside?" Someone else.

"It's locked. Has been for months since we closed the crew season."

Please don't check the lock, I prayed silently.

The footsteps moved away, conversation fading. We waited in the darkness, hearts pounding, aware of how close we'd come.

When silence returned, Owen looked at me and started laughing quietly.

"This," he whispered, "is exactly the kind of thing my parents would find hilarious. 'Use your knowledge of authority patterns,' they'd say. 'Calculate risk versus reward.'"

"Did we calculate wrong?" I whispered back.

"Probably. But I don't regret it."

Neither did I.

We waited another ten minutes to be safe, then slipped out of the boathouse and parted at the quad. The almost-kiss lingered between us—interrupted but not forgotten.

Walking back to Whitmore Hall, I thought about Sarah's question. Was I losing myself in this?

No. I was finding myself. Through Owen, through questions, through choosing differently than I'd been taught.

Even if it meant risking everything I'd built.

The choice felt clear.
