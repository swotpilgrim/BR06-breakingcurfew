# Chapter 5: Aftermath

I barely slept.

Every time I closed my eyes, I replayed the scene—Owen climbing through the window, Mr. Hartwell approaching, my feet moving before my mind could object. The lie. Owen's hand on my wrist. His question: Why did you do that?

I still didn't have an answer.

Beside me, Sarah's breathing stayed deep and even—someone with a clear conscience. I used to sleep like that too, before I'd become the kind of person who covered for rule-breakers.

By the time gray light filtered through our window, I'd managed maybe two hours of sleep. The rest was restless half-consciousness, my mind churning through Owen's questions. Why had I protected him? What did it mean?

Sarah's alarm went off at 6:30. She groaned, reaching over to silence it, then rolled to look at me. "You're already awake?"

"Couldn't sleep." Not a lie. The truth, just not all of it.

"Still stressed about your thesis?" Sarah asked.

I nodded, accepting the explanation. Yes. My thesis. Not the fact that I couldn't stop thinking about the boy who'd noticed me breaking my own rules.

We went through our morning routine—shower, uniform, quick breakfast. Everything exactly as always, except I felt like I was moving through water, every action requiring conscious effort.

The student council meeting started at 8:30 sharp. I arrived at 8:25—still early, but not my usual five minutes. James was already there, reviewing his notes at the head of the table. He glanced up when I entered.

"Morning, Charlotte. You have the curfew monitoring schedule?"

"Yes," I said, pulling out the chart I'd completed yesterday. Before everything. When my biggest concern had been coordinating volunteers and color-coding time slots.

The other council members filtered in, and James called the meeting to order. Assembly announcements, fall formal planning, Washington trip fundraiser.

I contributed where appropriate. Or tried to. But my mind kept drifting.

"—Charlotte's thoughts on that?"

I looked up to find everyone staring, waiting for a response to a question I hadn't heard.

"Sorry," I said. "Could you repeat that?"

James frowned. "The fundraiser proposal. Car wash or bake sale first?"

"Car wash. Better profit margin."

"Right." James made a note, watching me with concern. "Are you feeling all right? You seem distracted."

"Just tired. Didn't sleep well."

"Maybe you should go to the health center."

"I'm fine. Just need more coffee."

The meeting continued, but I could feel James watching me, that small crease appearing when something didn't fit his expectations. Charlotte Pierce didn't show up distracted. Charlotte Pierce was always focused.

Except today she wasn't.

By the time we adjourned at 9:20, I had seven new items in my planner and only vague recollection of how they'd gotten there. I checked James's notes to make sure I hadn't missed anything critical, then headed to AP Literature.

Mr. Hartwell's history class was after lunch. I spent all of Literature trying not to think about seeing him, about whether he'd look at me differently, whether he'd reconsidered last night's encounter and decided my story didn't quite add up.

But when I finally sat down in his classroom, Mr. Hartwell greeted me with the same friendly nod he always did, no suspicion or concern in his expression. The lie had worked. As far as he knew, Charlotte Pierce had simply been getting information about an assignment from a classmate.

My perfect record remained intact.

So why did I feel like something fundamental had shifted?

Lunch was the worst.

I sat at the student council table, picking at my food while conversation flowed around me. Sarah told a story about her dining hall shift. I laughed at the right moments, maintained the performance of normalcy.

Then Owen Riley walked into the dining hall.

My attention immediately snapped to him, tracking his movement with awareness I couldn't explain.

He collected his tray, surveyed the room, and started walking.

Toward our table.

My heart began beating too fast.

Owen didn't come to the student council table. No one came to the student council table unless they were student council, except to deliver messages or ask official questions. It was one of those unspoken rules, the invisible boundaries that organized Fairmont's social life.

But Owen was walking straight toward us with that easy confidence he always wore, like social boundaries simply didn't apply to him.

He stopped at our table, directly across from where I sat.

"Hey," he said casually. "Charlotte. Thanks again for the reading list last night. Really helped me get started on the research."

The table had gone quiet. James was staring at Owen with barely concealed surprise. Sarah's eyes had gone wide. The other council members were exchanging glances.

I forced my voice to sound normal. "No problem. Glad it was useful."

"Mr. Hartwell's debate assignment is going to be intense," Owen continued, still speaking to me but loud enough that the whole table could hear. "If you need any of the sources I found, just let me know."

"Thanks," I managed.

Owen smiled—friendly, casual, completely innocent to anyone who didn't know what had actually happened last night. "See you in class."

Then he walked away, heading to a table with David Chen and some other artists, leaving a wake of confused silence behind him.

"Since when do you collaborate with Owen Riley?" James asked, his tone suggesting this was a violation of natural law.

"Since Mr. Hartwell assigned a major debate assignment," I said, keeping my voice steady. "Owen offered to share his reading list. I figured it would save time."

"Still," James said. "Owen Riley. He's not exactly... our type."

Our type. Meaning rule-followers, tradition-respecters, students who understood that Fairmont's structure existed for good reason. Owen was the opposite of that—questioner, boundary-crosser, someone who made administrators nervous.

"He's a good student," I said, surprising myself with the defense. "Smart, well-read. Why wouldn't I accept academic help from him?"

James looked at me like I'd started speaking another language. "I suppose. I just didn't realize you two were... friendly."

"We're not." The words came out sharper than intended. "We're just both taking history. That's all."

Sarah was watching me with that puzzled expression again, the one that said she knew something was off but couldn't quite figure out what. I focused on my lunch, willing the conversation to move on.

It eventually did, shifting to fall formal dress code enforcement and whether we needed to be stricter about approved styles. But I couldn't focus. I kept replaying Owen's performance—the casual thanks, the innocent mention of research, the way he'd acknowledged last night without revealing anything real.

He'd been thanking me. Publicly, safely, in a way that sounded completely normal but carried weight for anyone who knew the truth.

And something about that made me feel seen in a way I hadn't expected.

The afternoon dragged. Chemistry lab where I redid a titration three times from lost concentration. Free period staring at thesis notes without processing anything. By 3:45, I was exhausted from maintaining normalcy while my thoughts spiraled.

I was packing up when someone tapped my shoulder.

Owen.

"Got a minute?" he asked quietly.

Every instinct screamed danger. The smart thing would be to make an excuse, walk away.

"Okay," I heard myself say.

Owen gestured toward the library. "Quieter there."

I fell into step beside him, hyperaware of students around us, wondering if anyone noticed.

The library was moderately busy. Owen led me to the second floor, to a quiet corner. The same corner where he'd invited me on a midnight adventure.

Where I'd said yes.

Owen set his bag down. "You look tired."

"Didn't sleep well." I didn't add 'because of you' but it hung in the air between us anyway.

"Me neither." He studied my face. "You've been thinking about it. About why you helped me."

It wasn't a question. "Doesn't matter. It's done. We got away with it. We should probably just... not talk about it."

"Why?"

"Because talking about it makes it real," I said, more honestly than I'd intended. "Right now it's just something that happened. If we analyze it, give it weight and meaning, then it becomes something I have to deal with."

Owen's expression shifted, something like understanding crossing his face. "And you're not ready to deal with it."

"I don't even know what 'it' is."

"Fair enough." He was quiet for a moment, then: "I'm not trying to make your life complicated, Charlotte. That's not what last night was about."

"Then what was it about?"

"Honestly?" Owen leaned against the desk behind him. "I'm still trying to figure that out. You surprised me. Charlotte Pierce, perfect student council VP, lying for someone she barely knows. That doesn't fit with everything I thought I knew about you."

"Maybe you don't know me as well as you think."

"Maybe I don't." He smiled slightly. "But I'd like to."

The words hung in the air between us, weighted with possibility I wasn't ready to name.

"I should go," I said, even though I made no move toward my bag. "I have a thesis meeting at 4:30."

"Charlotte," Owen said quietly. "What happened last night... you can pretend it didn't matter. You can add it to your color-coded schedule as a one-time anomaly and move on. But I don't think you will."

"Why not?"

"Because I saw your face when you walked away from Prescott Hall. You weren't scared you'd get caught. You were exhilarated that you hadn't. And that's not something you can schedule away."

He was right, which terrified me. The lie to Mr. Hartwell should have been my lowest point at Fairmont—the moment I compromised everything I'd built. Instead, it had felt like the most real thing I'd done in three years.

"I really do have a meeting," I said, picking up my bag.

"I know." Owen straightened. "But Charlotte? When you can't sleep tonight, when you're lying there trying to understand why you did what you did... consider the possibility that maybe you did it because some part of you wanted to."

I left without responding, my mind too full to formulate words.

But as I walked to my thesis meeting, planner in hand and schedule intact, I couldn't stop thinking about Owen's words.

Maybe you did it because some part of you wanted to.

The thought was terrifying.

It was also, I was starting to suspect, true.
