# Chapter 10: Secret Meetings

The second Friday came faster than I expected.

All week, I'd been different. Small changes that probably no one else noticed but felt seismic to me. Erasing scheduled library hours. Spending an evening in the art studio with David and Owen. Speaking up in Mr. Hartwell's class with opinions that challenged rather than affirmed.

Sarah noticed something. She kept giving me puzzled looks, asking if I was okay, commenting that I seemed distracted. I kept lying, kept saying I was fine, kept hiding the truth.

By Friday night, I was vibrating with anticipation.

At 10:50, I slipped out of bed, already dressed. Sarah's breathing was deep and even. I moved through our room like a ghost, out the door, down the hallway to the common room window.

Owen was waiting at the chapel maintenance door, exactly where he'd been last week.

"You came," he said, smiling.

"Did you doubt I would?"

"A little." He started walking, and I fell into step. "Charlotte Pierce missing two Friday nights in a row? That's a pattern, not an anomaly."

"Maybe I like patterns," I said. "Just different ones than before."

We didn't go to the bell tower. Instead, Owen led me across campus toward the water. Fairmont sat on Maine's coast, the Atlantic a constant presence we could hear but rarely accessed. The shoreline belonged to maintenance roads and storage buildings, technically off-limits after dark.

Owen knew the way even in darkness. We followed a maintenance road past the boathouse, down a slope, until suddenly we were on the beach—rocky Maine shore with waves breaking white in the moonlight.

"Oh," I breathed, stopping.

"Better view than the tower," Owen said. "Different, anyway."

We sat on the cold rocks, close enough that our shoulders touched. The ocean stretched endless before us, silver-black under the night sky. Waves crashed and retreated, crashed and retreated, following rhythms older than Fairmont's rules.

"I've been here three years," I said quietly, "and I never knew this was accessible."

"Because you followed the designated paths." Owen picked up a smooth stone, turned it over in his hands. "Fairmont has all these hidden spaces. You just have to be willing to look beyond the map they give you."

"Is that a metaphor?"

"Everything's a metaphor if you think about it long enough." He tossed the stone toward the water. It disappeared into darkness. "But yeah, probably. Life has designated paths too. College, career, marriage, kids. All mapped out, all approved. Most people just follow along."

"And you don't?"

"I try not to. My parents raised me to question maps." Owen glanced at me. "What about you? You questioning yours yet?"

I thought about my Wellesley application, my pre-law plans, my entire future mapped out before I'd consciously chosen any of it. "I'm starting to."

We sat in comfortable silence, listening to waves. I'd never been comfortable with silence before—always felt obligated to fill it with productivity or conversation. But with Owen, silence felt natural. Like we didn't need words to communicate.

"Can I ask you something?" I said finally.

"Always."

"Why do you do this? The midnight runs, breaking curfew, all of it. Is it actually about freedom, or is it just rebellion for rebellion's sake?"

Owen was quiet for a long moment, watching waves. "Honestly? It started as rebellion. Freshman year, my roommate dared me to sneak out. I did it once, got a rush from it, kept doing it." He paused. "But somewhere along the way, it became something else. These nights became when I felt most like myself. When I could think without Fairmont's structure pressing down on me. Now..." He shrugged. "Now it's less about breaking rules and more about claiming space that's mine."

"That makes sense."

"You're doing the same thing," Owen said. "You're not here because you want to break rules. You're here because these nights let you be Charlotte instead of Charlotte Pierce, perfect student."

He was right. Again. I was starting to hate how often he was right.

We stayed until almost one AM, talking about everything and nothing. Owen's parents and their philosophy of questioning authority. My brother and the impossible standard he'd set. What we actually wanted versus what we thought we should want. The difference between success and satisfaction.

When we finally headed back, my cheeks hurt from smiling. We parted at the quad, Owen returning my jacket with a "see you next week" that sounded like a promise.

The third Friday, Owen took me to the old maintenance building behind the athletic fields. Inside, climbing a narrow ladder, we reached a loft space filled with forgotten equipment. Owen had brought blankets, made it into a kind of hideout.

We lay on our backs, looking up at the rafters, and Owen asked about my thesis.

"I don't care about it," I admitted. "European romanticism's influence on American literature—it's appropriately intellectual, looks good on applications, checks all the boxes. But I don't actually care."

"So why write about it?"

"Because it's what I'm supposed to write about. The kind of topic that shows I'm serious, scholarly, ready for college-level work."

"But what would you write about if you could choose anything?"

The question stopped me. When had I last thought about what I actually wanted to study?

"I don't know," I said quietly. "I've spent so long focusing on what would impress admissions committees that I've forgotten what interests me."

"So figure it out," Owen said. "You have months before the thesis is due. Write about something that actually matters to you."

"That's terrifying."

"Good things usually are."

The fourth Friday, we went back to the bell tower. This time I wasn't nervous climbing the spiral stairs, wasn't scared of breaking curfew. This was becoming routine—my routine, chosen consciously.

From the observation platform, Owen pointed out constellations. I'd never paid attention to stars before, too busy with schedules to look up.

"That's Cassiopeia," Owen said, tracing the W-shape. "And there's the North Star. Sailors used to navigate by stars before GPS."

"How do you know all this?"

"My dad. He's big on self-reliance, knowing how to find your way without technology." Owen lowered his hand. "Plus, when you spend a lot of nights outside, you start noticing what's up there."

We stood close at the railing, not quite touching but aware of each other. The October air was cold, sharp with coming winter.

"Thank you," I said quietly.

"For what?"

"For this. For showing me there's more to Fairmont than my schedule. For not pushing me, just letting me explore at my own pace." I looked at him. "For seeing me."

Owen turned to face me fully. In the dim light from the quad below, his expression was serious.

"Charlotte, I need you to understand something," he said. "I'm not trying to rescue you or fix you or convert you to my way of thinking. You're not a project. You're a person making her own choices, and I'm just... glad you're choosing to spend some of these nights with me."

Something warm bloomed in my chest. Not just gratitude—something deeper, more complicated.

"I'm glad too," I managed.

We stood there, close enough that I could feel his warmth, aware of the space between us shrinking. My heart was pounding, and not from fear of getting caught.

Owen reached out slowly, giving me time to step back if I wanted. His hand cupped my face, thumb brushing my cheekbone.

"Charlotte," he said softly.

"Yeah?"

"Can I kiss you?"

My first thought was how different this was from what I'd imagined first kisses would be like. No grand romantic gesture, no perfect moment orchestrated and planned. Just honest question in darkness, choice offered freely.

My second thought was yes.

"Yes," I whispered.

Owen leaned in slowly, still giving me space to change my mind, to step back, to choose differently. But I didn't want to choose differently.

Our lips met, soft and careful. Not passionate or overwhelming—just real. Real in a way nothing in my carefully planned life had been real.

When we pulled back, Owen was smiling. "Still glad you said yes to midnight adventures?"

"Very glad," I said, smiling back.

We stayed at the tower another hour, sometimes talking, sometimes just standing close. When we finally headed back, walking across the dark quad, something fundamental had shifted.

I wasn't just breaking curfew anymore. I wasn't just exploring hidden spaces or questioning my designated path.

I was falling for Owen Riley, and that was the most terrifying, exhilarating, completely unplanned thing I'd ever done.

Back in my room, safe in bed with Sarah sleeping across from me, I touched my lips and smiled in the darkness.

My planner sat on my desk, color-coded and organized. But beside it now sat Owen's philosophy book—Camus, "The Rebel"—which he'd loaned me.

The designated path and the chosen one, sitting side by side.

I was starting to figure out which one mattered more.
