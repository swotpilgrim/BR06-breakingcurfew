# Chapter 22: Guilt

Sunday afternoon, I found Owen in the art studio with David, bent over photography prints in deep conversation.

They looked up when I entered.

"Charlotte," Owen said, standing quickly.

"I can come back."

"You're not interrupting." David gestured to the photos—his after-dark campus series. "I was just telling Owen that his girlfriend is braver than he is."

"She's not—we're not—" Owen stumbled, glancing at me.

"Whatever label you want," David said. "Point stands."

I moved closer. The bell tower at midnight, the quad empty and peaceful. Fairmont stripped of its daytime performance.

"These are beautiful."

"Thanks. Owen was asking if he should try to convince you to be more strategic tomorrow. I told him that was exactly the wrong approach."

Owen shot David a look. "I wasn't asking if I should convince her. I was asking if staying silent while she self-destructs is the right move."

"I'm standing right here," I pointed out.

"Sorry." Owen ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident. "Charlotte, can we talk? Alone?"

David gathered some prints. "I need to hit the darkroom anyway. Charlotte—good luck tomorrow. Mean it."

After he left, Owen and I stood in the studio surrounded by art supplies and afternoon light.

"You think I'm self-destructing," I said.

"I think you're choosing honesty over strategy in a situation where strategy would serve you better." He paused. "But David's right that it's not my place to convince you otherwise."

"So what were you two actually talking about?"

Owen was quiet for a moment, then gestured to chairs by the window. We sat, the studio peaceful around us.

"I was telling David this is my fault," he said finally. "That I encouraged you to question rules, break curfew, challenge your parents. And now you're facing suspension because I pushed you toward rebellion."

"Owen—"

"Let me finish." He leaned forward. "I've been thinking about this all weekend. About how I saw you as trapped and made it my mission to help you break free. But that's just another form of control. Me deciding what freedom should look like and pushing you toward it."

I thought about our conversations where Owen had suggested I quit honor society, reconsider Wellesley, be more honest.

"You were trying to help."

"Was I? Or was I trying to make you into who I thought you should be? Someone who questions everything, doesn't care about approval, values authenticity over success." He shook his head. "That's who I am. But maybe not who you are, and I didn't give you space to figure that out."

"You didn't force me to do anything."

"No, but I influenced you. And I keep telling myself that's different, but Charlotte—when you care about someone and they're figuring out who they are, influence can feel a lot like pressure."

I watched him, this boy who'd shown me possibilities I hadn't considered, who'd helped me see beyond the perfect-daughter performance. "What did David say when you told him this?"

"That I was being arrogant. That taking responsibility for your choices away from you was another way of not seeing you fully." Owen smiled slightly. "He has a way of being blunt."

"He does. But he's also right."

"I know. That's why it stung." Owen turned to face me. "Charlotte, I need you to know—whatever you decide to say tomorrow, whatever happens in that hearing, I'm not going to try to influence it. I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do or how you should handle it. Your choice, your consequences, your path."

"What if I want your opinion?"

"Then I'll give it. But as input, not direction. And you get to ignore it completely without me making you feel guilty for that."

I reached for his hand. "Owen, you're being too hard on yourself. Yes, you influenced me. But that influence helped me see options I didn't know existed. You showed me the window, remember?"

"And then maybe pushed you toward jumping out of it instead of letting you decide if you wanted to climb through on your own terms."

"Maybe. But I jumped. That was my choice." I squeezed his hand. "Owen, I need you to stop feeling guilty about this. You're not responsible for my decisions."

"I know. Intellectually, I know that. But Charlotte—watching you face consequences for choices I encouraged, knowing your applications might be damaged, seeing your parents' disappointment—it's hard not to feel like I caused that."

"You didn't cause it. You catalyzed it. There's a difference."

He looked at me, something between gratitude and pain in his expression. "How are you so clear about this when I'm a mess?"

"Because I spent seventeen years letting other people take credit for my choices—good ones and bad ones. I'm not doing that anymore. Not even to let you feel appropriately guilty." I shifted closer. "Owen, you helped me. You showed me that questioning was possible, that rules weren't absolute, that my parents' approval wasn't the only thing that mattered. But helping isn't the same as causing. And I need you to trust that I made my own choices here."

He was quiet for a long moment. "What if your own choices lead to consequences I could have helped you avoid?"

"Then that's my lesson to learn, not your failure to prevent."

"That's hard to watch."

"I know. But that's what supporting someone looks like—trusting them to face their own consequences instead of trying to protect them from every difficulty."

Owen shook his head with a slight laugh. "When did you get so wise?"

"I'm not wise. I'm just figuring things out as I go and trying to be honest about that process." I paused. "Owen, can I ask you something?"

"Anything."

"Why do you feel so responsible for other people's choices?"

The question seemed to catch him off guard. He thought about it, staring out the studio window at campus below.

"My parents raised me to question everything," he said finally. "To challenge authority, value independent thought. That framework has served me well—I know who I am, I'm comfortable with uncertainty."

"But?"

"But I think I've started believing my way is the right way. That people who follow rules are trapped and need rescuing. Which is arrogant."

"You don't think some people are trapped?"

"Maybe. But trapped people still choose whether and how they want to escape. Assuming I know better than they do what freedom should look like—that's just another form of control."

I thought about Mr. Hartwell's question—whether questioning rules and breaking rules were the same thing. About the distinction between thinking critically and acting on that thinking. About choosing consciously rather than rebelling automatically.

"I think," I said carefully, "that you showed me questioning was possible. And that was exactly what I needed. But you're right that how I act on that questioning—that has to be my choice."

"And if I think you're making the wrong choice?"

"Then you tell me that, and I consider it, and I still make my own decision."

"Even if I think that decision is self-destructive?"

"Even then. Because Owen—you trusting me to make my own choices and face my own consequences is more valuable than you protecting me from difficulty."

He pulled me closer, arms around me in a hug that felt like both comfort and apology. "I'm still going to worry about you tomorrow."

"That's allowed. Worry is different from trying to control the outcome."

"Is it?"

"Yes. Worry is caring. Control is not trusting."

We sat like that for a while, the studio quiet. Through the window, students crossed the quad, living normal Sunday routines. Tomorrow mine would be anything but normal.

"Charlotte?" Owen's voice was quiet. "What are you actually going to say tomorrow?"

"The truth. That I broke rules, understand consequences, and I'm not sorry for the growth that led me here."

"That's not going to help you."

"I know."

"But you're saying it anyway."

"Yes."

He pulled back. "Why?"

"Because saying anything else would just be another version of being what people expect instead of being honest. And I can't go backward now."

Owen studied my face. "You're terrified, aren't you?"

"Completely."

"But doing it anyway."

"That's brave, Charlotte. Also possibly stupid. But definitely brave."

I smiled slightly. "Those things aren't mutually exclusive."

He stood, pulling me up. "Come on. Let's get out before David comes back and tells me all the ways I'm still being controlling."

"He'd probably be right."

"Probably. But I don't need to hear it again today."

We walked across campus together, the December afternoon cold and gray. Tomorrow my parents would arrive. The hearing would happen. Consequences would follow.

But today, walking beside Owen who was learning to support rather than direct, I felt less alone.

"Owen?" I said as we approached Whitmore Hall. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For caring enough to question whether you're helping or controlling. For trying to support my choices even when you disagree with them. For trusting me to face my own consequences."

"I'm not doing it very well."

"You're doing it better than you think." I stopped at the dorm entrance. "And Owen? I need you to know that whatever happens tomorrow—however the hearing goes, whatever my parents say, whatever consequences follow—I don't regret anything about this semester. Including meeting you. Especially meeting you."

His expression shifted—relief mixed with something tender. "Even though I catalyzed your rebellion?"

"Because you catalyzed my rebellion. Which I needed, even if the consequences are difficult."

"Charlotte—"

"I know. We're not defining what this is yet. But I needed you to know that. Whatever tomorrow brings."

He pulled me into another hug. "I'll be thinking about you tomorrow. During the hearing."

"I know."

"And after—however it goes—I'll be here. Not trying to fix it. Just here."

"That's exactly what I need."

We separated at the dorm entrance. I watched him go, this boy learning that love meant trusting someone to make their own choices.

Upstairs, Sarah looked up from her homework. "Was that Owen?"

"Yeah."

"How is he?"

"Guilty. Learning. Growing."

"Aren't we all." She set down her pen. "Do you want me there tomorrow? After the hearing?"

"You have class."

"I can skip."

The offer touched me. "Thank you. But I think I need to do this part alone."

"And then?"

"Then I'll need my best friend to help me figure out what comes next."

She nodded. "I can do that."

That night, lying in bed with tomorrow looming, I thought about Owen's guilt, David's bluntness, Mr. Hartwell's questions about rules and community.

I thought about my prepared statement, my decision to speak truth, my choice to stop performing.

And I realized that however tomorrow went—suspension or probation, fury or damage—I'd already won something.

I'd found my voice.

Whatever the committee decided couldn't take that away.
