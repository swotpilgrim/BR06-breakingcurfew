# Chapter 16: Family Weekend

I spotted my mother's Mercedes from my dorm window Friday afternoon, its silver paint gleaming against the gray December sky like a beacon of expectation. My stomach tightened into the familiar knot I'd learned to ignore during my first three years at Fairmont—the one that appeared whenever I had to perform being the daughter my parents expected.

"They're here," I said to Sarah, who was sprawling on her bed reading.

She glanced up. "You okay?"

I nodded, smoothing my cardigan and checking my reflection. Hair in place. Posture straight. The Charlotte Pierce my parents expected looked back at me—the one who'd been slipping lately, replaced by someone who climbed bell towers after midnight and questioned authority in class.

"You'll be fine," Sarah said, but concern edged her voice. She'd watched me transform back into perfect-daughter mode all afternoon.

This weekend terrified me more than any disciplinary hearing could. My parents would see exactly what I showed them, and after weeks of discovering who I actually was, that performance felt like erasing myself.

The knock on our door came precisely at four o'clock. Of course it did. Margaret Pierce was never late.

"Charlotte." My mother's voice carried through the hallway before I even opened the door. "Stand up straight, darling. Your posture."

I straightened automatically, muscle memory from years of corrections. When I opened the door, my mother swept in wearing a tailored wool suit the color of champagne, pearls at her throat, her blonde hair styled in the same neat bob she'd worn since I was a child. Behind her, my father filled the doorway in his lawyer's uniform—dark suit, crimson tie, expression that suggested he was mentally reviewing a contract even while supposedly visiting his daughter.

"Let me look at you." My mother held me at arm's length, eyes scanning for imperfections. "You look tired. Are you sleeping enough? And this cardigan—is this new? The color washes you out."

"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad." I stepped back, gesturing to our room. "This is Sarah, my roommate."

Sarah stood politely. "It's lovely to meet you both."

My mother offered a perfunctory smile before turning back to me. "Your father and I checked into the inn. We'll expect you for dinner at six—they're serving in the formal dining hall tonight for families. The headmaster will be addressing parents."

"How are your grades?" my father asked, his first words to me. Not *how are you* or *we missed you*. Just straight to the metrics that mattered.

"Strong," I said, falling into the expected script. "All A's except for one A-minus in chemistry, but I'm working with the teacher to bring it up."

"An A-minus." My father frowned slightly. "That's not like you, Charlotte. Is something distracting you?"

Everything, I thought. Questions and midnight conversations and a boy who sees me as something other than a grade point average. "No," I said aloud. "Just a challenging course. I have it under control."

"Your brother maintained a perfect transcript at Yale," my mother added, as if I could possibly have forgotten. "That was crucial for his law school applications. You can't afford slip-ups now, not in your senior year."

"I know."

"Speaking of your brother," my father checked his watch, "he sends his regrets. Mock trial nationals conflicted with this weekend. But he wanted me to tell you he's proud of your student council work."

The knot in my stomach tightened. Even when absent, my brother cast a shadow I was supposed to measure up to. "That's nice of him."

"Well." My mother straightened her already-straight pearls. "We'll let you prepare for dinner. Wear something appropriate, Charlotte. First impressions matter, even with teachers you already know."

After they left, Sarah released a low whistle. "Wow."

"Yeah." I sank onto my bed, suddenly exhausted and they'd been here less than ten minutes.

"That's… a lot."

"That's my parents." I stared at the conservative navy dress I'd already laid out for dinner. "Welcome to my next forty-eight hours."

The formal dining hall gleamed under chandelier light, long tables draped in white cloths. Parents in suits and pearls mingled with faculty while students stood in careful clusters, backs straight and voices modulated. Fairmont at its most traditional.

I spotted Owen across the room with his parents—his mother in a flowing batik skirt, his father in corduroy and turtleneck. They looked relaxed, laughing together. When Owen caught my eye, I saw the question there—*are you okay?*

I looked away before my mother noticed.

"Charlotte." She touched my elbow, guiding me toward a table where several of my teachers waited with their spouses. "Dr. Nguyen is your English teacher, correct? Let's speak with him."

An hour of carefully orchestrated conversations followed, my parents asking pointed questions disguised as polite interest. How was my participation? What did Dr. Nguyen think of my essays? Was I demonstrating the critical thinking that would serve me well at a competitive college?

Dr. Nguyen, bless him, answered diplomatically. "Charlotte is an exceptional student. Her recent work has shown particular depth—she's asking more complex questions than she did earlier in the year."

"Questions?" My father's tone sharpened slightly. "As in challenging the curriculum?"

"As in demonstrating genuine intellectual engagement," Dr. Nguyen said smoothly. "Exactly what we hope to see in our seniors."

But I caught my mother's expression—the slight tightening around her eyes that meant she'd file this away for later discussion. *Questions* meant unpredictability. My parents valued achievement, not curiosity.

At dinner, I sat between them, cutting my chicken into precise bites and nodding at appropriate moments. I barely tasted the food, too busy monitoring myself—my posture, my expression, my words. Making sure nothing slipped.

Across the dining hall, Owen watched. Not obviously, but I felt his glances like pressure on my skin. He could see me performing, see how differently I carried myself. Smaller. Quieter. More careful.

The Charlotte he knew from the bell tower had disappeared, replaced by an automaton who smiled politely and never disagreed.

"Charlotte?" My mother's voice pulled me back. "Mrs. Whitmore was asking about your plans for student council next semester."

I turned to James's mother with my practiced smile. "We're hoping to expand the peer tutoring program and organize the spring formal. James has been a wonderful president to work with."

"He speaks highly of you as well," Mrs. Whitmore said warmly. "He mentioned you two might attend the formal together?"

My mother's interest sharpened. "Oh?"

"Nothing's been decided," I said quickly, feeling trapped. James had hinted, but I'd been carefully non-committal. Now his mother was bringing it up in front of my parents, cementing expectations I hadn't agreed to.

"James Whitmore is an excellent young man," my father said approvingly. "Legacy student, strong academics, planning for law school. You could do much worse, Charlotte."

I wanted to point out that I was seventeen and not shopping for a husband. That I'd rather climb bell towers with a boy who questioned authority than attend formals with someone who embodied it.

Instead, I said, "He's very dedicated to student council work."

Safe. Neutral. Expected.

The headmaster's speech droned on about Fairmont's traditions and academic excellence. My mother nodded approvingly at each mention of discipline and standards. My father checked his phone twice under the table.

I sat very still and hated myself for how easily I slipped back into this role.

---

Saturday brought more of the same. My mother critiqued everything during our campus tour—my appearance, my study habits, my future. "You'll need to finalize your Wellesley application over winter break."

I walked her through campus like a tour guide, pointing out buildings while she pointed out my failures.

At the library, she paused with approval. "This is where you should spend your time. Not socializing in your dorm."

From the corner of my eye, I saw Owen on a bench near the steps, book in hand. He glanced up and registered how I stood—shoulders hunched, head down, following a half-step behind my mother. The opposite of how I climbed to the bell tower.

Our eyes met briefly. I saw understanding there, and sympathy. Then my mother was pulling me toward the administration building, and I had to turn away.

---

Saturday evening's formal dinner was the worst. My parents had requested a private table with the headmaster and Dean of Students—a power dinner where they could discuss my future with Fairmont's leadership.

I sat in my best dress, hair perfect, posture straight, while the adults discussed me like I wasn't there.

"Charlotte has been an exemplary student," Headmaster Ashford said. "Her record is outstanding."

"We expect her early admission to Wellesley to be strong," my father said. "She'll follow a pre-law track, like her brother at Yale."

No one asked if that was what I wanted. No one asked what I might prefer to study, where else I might want to apply, what kind of future I imagined for myself.

"The Pierce family legacy of academic excellence is certainly being upheld," the Dean said smoothly.

My mother smiled with satisfaction. "Charlotte understands the importance of maintaining standards. She's never given us cause for concern."

I cut my roasted vegetables into smaller and smaller pieces and said nothing.

"Though I understand there was a minor grade slip in chemistry?" my father asked the headmaster.

"Hardly concerning," Dr. Ashford assured him. "Still well within A range. Charlotte's academic record is exemplary."

They moved on to discussing campus facilities and donor programs. I stopped listening, my mind drifting to the bell tower, to Owen asking me what I actually wanted rather than what I was supposed to want.

The rebel I'd been becoming felt very far away, vanished under my mother's pearls and my father's expectations.

I was performing perfection again. And I was very, very good at it.

By the time my parents left Sunday afternoon, I felt hollowed out. I'd spent two days being exactly who they needed me to be, and it had required erasing everything I'd learned about myself this semester.

Sarah found me in our room afterward, still in my conservative outfit, staring at nothing.

"You okay?" she asked gently.

I didn't know how to answer. I'd survived the weekend without disappointing them, maintained the facade perfectly. They'd left satisfied I was still their dutiful daughter, still on track for their planned future.

But for the first time, their approval felt like failure.

"I don't know who I am anymore," I said finally. "The girl they see or the person I've been becoming."

"Maybe," Sarah said carefully, "they're both real. And you're figuring out which one you want to be."

I thought about that as December darkness fell outside. About choices and authenticity and the exhausting weight of performance.

How much longer could I keep living two different lives?
