# Chapter 14: Friends Notice

Sarah was waiting when I returned from the library Tuesday evening.

Not just in our room—waiting. Sitting on her bed, arms crossed, expression serious in a way I'd never seen before.

"We need to talk," she said.

My stomach dropped. "About what?"

"About whatever's been going on with you. About the midnight absences, the personality changes, the secrets." Sarah's voice was quiet but firm. "I've given you space, Charlotte. I've waited for you to tell me when you were ready. But it's been two months and you're still lying to me."

I set my bag down slowly. "I haven't lied to you."

"You've lied by omission. That counts." Sarah stood. "I know you've been sneaking out. I know it's Owen Riley. I know you're risking everything—your record, your future, maybe even your safety—for whatever this is."

"I'm safe," I said quietly. "I promise."

"That's not enough anymore." Sarah's eyes were bright with emotion. "You're my best friend, Charlotte. Three years we've been roommates, and I've watched you transform from someone I knew inside and out to someone I barely recognize. And you won't even tell me why."

The hurt in her voice cracked something in my chest.

"I'm not trying to shut you out," I said. "I just... I needed space to figure out who I am when I'm not performing for everyone."

"And you couldn't figure that out while still trusting me?"

"It's not about trust. It's about—" I struggled to find words. "Sarah, if I tell you what I've been doing, you'd have to choose between covering for me and reporting me. I won't put you in that position."

"So you'd rather just lie?"

"I'd rather protect you from having to make that choice."

Sarah laughed without humor. "Charlotte, you're protecting yourself. You don't want me to know because you're ashamed of what you're doing, or you know I'd tell you to stop, or both."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Sarah sat back down heavily. "You've worked so hard to build this perfect record. Three years of being the model student, the reliable friend, the girl everyone could count on. And now you're throwing it away for... what? Late-night adventures with a boy who thinks rules don't apply to him?"

"Owen's not—" I stopped myself. Defending Owen would only confirm Sarah's suspicions.

"I've watched you change," Sarah continued, voice breaking slightly. "You question everything James says. You skip obligations. You sit with different people. You stopped caring about the things that used to matter to you. And maybe that's growth, maybe it's self-discovery, but from where I'm sitting it looks like you're losing yourself to be someone Owen wants you to be."

The accusation stung because part of me worried it might be true.

"Owen hasn't made me change," I said carefully. "He's just shown me that change is possible. That I don't have to follow the script everyone wrote for me."

"But what if the script was good?" Sarah asked. "What if your goals—Wellesley, law school, building a successful future—what if those were good things worth pursuing? Just because someone else suggested them doesn't make them wrong."

"And just because they're sensible doesn't make them right for me."

We stared at each other across the small room that had been our shared space for three years.

"I'm worried about you," Sarah said finally. "Not because I think you're making mistakes, but because I don't know if you're making choices or just rebelling. And I can't help you figure out the difference because you won't let me in."

Guilt and frustration warred in my chest. "I don't know how to let you in without putting you at risk."

"Then stop doing things that create risk," Sarah said simply. "Stop sneaking out. Stop breaking rules. Stop lying to everyone including yourself."

"I'm not lying to myself. For the first time in three years, I'm being honest with myself."

"Are you?" Sarah's expression was sad. "Because it looks to me like you've just traded one performance for another. Before you were Charlotte Pierce, perfect student. Now you're Charlotte Pierce, enlightened rebel. But either way, you're still performing."

The words hit harder than anything else she'd said. Because what if she was right? What if I was just being contrary for its own sake, defining myself in opposition to expectations rather than through genuine choice?

"I need to think," I said quietly.

"That's all I want," Sarah said. "For you to actually think about whether this is who you want to be, or just who you think you should be to prove you're different."

The conversation haunted me for days.

Thursday at lunch, James approached me as I was heading to David's table.

"Charlotte, can I talk to you for a minute?"

I followed him to a quiet corner of the dining hall, already anticipating another confrontation about student council policies or my changed behavior.

But James looked nervous, not angry.

"I wanted to ask you something," he said, not quite meeting my eyes. "Spring formal is in March. I know it's early to be thinking about it, but tickets go on sale next week and..." He took a breath. "I'd like you to go with me. As my date."

Oh no.

James Whitmore, student council president, perfect Fairmont representative, embodiment of everything I'd thought I wanted to be. Asking me to spring formal.

Three months ago, I would have been thrilled. James was exactly the kind of person my parents would approve of, exactly the kind of date that fit with Charlotte Pierce's designated path.

But I wasn't that Charlotte anymore.

"James," I said gently, "I'm really flattered. But I don't think that's a good idea."

His face fell. "Why not?"

"Because..." How to say this honestly without hurting him more? "Because we see Fairmont differently now. You value traditions and structure and maintaining standards. And that's fine—that's who you are. But I'm questioning those things, and I don't think we're compatible anymore."

"We used to be," James said. "We used to understand each other perfectly. We wanted the same things."

"I know. But I've changed."

"Because of Owen Riley." It wasn't a question.

"Not just because of Owen. Because I started asking myself what I actually wanted instead of just accepting what I was supposed to want."

James shook his head slowly. "I don't understand you anymore, Charlotte. I don't understand why you're throwing away everything good about yourself—your discipline, your dedication, your respect for institutions—just to prove you can be different."

"I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm trying to be honest."

"By lying to everyone? By breaking rules? By rejecting the very things that made you successful?" James's voice rose slightly, then he checked himself. "I'm sorry. I don't mean to... I just miss the Charlotte who knew what she stood for."

"I still know what I stand for," I said quietly. "I just stand for different things now."

"Then I guess we really aren't compatible anymore." James stepped back, hurt evident in his expression. "I hope whatever you're choosing is worth what you're giving up."

He walked away before I could respond.

I stood there feeling terrible. James wasn't wrong to be hurt. I had changed, drastically, in ways that affected everyone around me. And I was causing pain to people who cared about me.

But going back—pretending to be the old Charlotte just to avoid disappointing people—felt impossible. Like trying to squeeze back into clothes I'd outgrown.

That night, I met Owen at the bell tower. I must have looked upset because his expression shifted immediately.

"What happened?"

I told him about Sarah's confrontation, about James asking me to the formal, about feeling like I was hurting everyone I cared about.

"Sarah thinks I'm just performing a different role," I said, staring out at the dark campus. "That I've traded perfect student for enlightened rebel without actually figuring out who I am."

"Is she right?" Owen asked carefully.

The question surprised me. "I thought you'd defend me. Tell me Sarah doesn't understand."

"I could do that," Owen said. "But you don't need me to tell you what you want to hear. You need me to be honest." He paused. "So I'll ask again—is Sarah right? Are you making genuine choices or just choosing whatever's opposite to your old path?"

I thought about it honestly. About my Wellesley rejection, my thesis topic change, my resistance to James's proposals. How much was authentic choice and how much was just rebellion for rebellion's sake?

"I don't know," I admitted. "Some of it feels genuine—like questioning whether pre-law is actually what I want. But maybe some of it is just me proving I can be different."

"That's honest," Owen said. "And it's okay to not have all the answers yet. Figuring out who you are isn't instant. It's messy and complicated and sometimes you make choices that turn out to be more about reaction than authentic desire."

"So how do I know the difference?"

"You ask yourself why you're choosing something. If the answer is 'because I actually want this,' that's authentic. If the answer is 'because it's different from what I used to choose' or 'because it proves something,' that's reaction." Owen met my eyes. "And Charlotte, being authentic might sometimes mean choosing things that look traditional. The point isn't that you choose differently—it's that you choose consciously."

His words settled something in me. "So if I decided I actually did want to go to Wellesley, that would be okay? Even after all this questioning?"

"If you chose it consciously, knowing your other options, understanding why it serves you—absolutely. The prison isn't Wellesley or pre-law or any specific path. The prison is following paths without choosing them."

I leaned against the railing, processing. "I think I need to talk to Sarah. Actually talk, not just defend myself."

"Probably," Owen agreed. "She's your best friend. She deserves honesty."

"Even if it means telling her about us? About the midnight meetings?"

"That's your call. But yeah, maybe trust her enough to let her make her own choices about what to do with that information."

Walking back to the dorm, I felt clearer than I had in days. Sarah was right to confront me. James was right to be hurt. And I needed to figure out which of my choices were authentic and which were just reactions.

But I also knew, with absolute certainty, that I didn't regret the path I was on. Even with its complications and consequences.

Because this path was mine.

And that mattered more than I could have imagined three months ago.
