# Chapter 3: The Window

At exactly 9:45 PM, I pushed through Prescott Library's heavy doors and stepped into the September night. The air had that crisp Maine quality—cool enough for my cardigan, not yet cold enough for a coat. Above me, the bell tower showed 9:46.

Fourteen minutes until curfew.

I followed my usual route—library to quad, across to the main pathway, past the chapel toward Whitmore Hall. Six minutes at normal pace. I always gave myself eight.

My mind was already on tomorrow. Student council meeting at 8:30—I still needed to finalize the curfew monitoring schedule. Then AP Literature, "The Great Gatsby" discussion. Mental note to review annotations. Calculus after that, then—

Movement caught my eye.

I stopped walking, not quite sure what I'd seen. Something near the boys' dormitory, Prescott Hall, which stood across the quad from Whitmore. A shadow that hadn't been there a moment ago. Or maybe it had, and I'd just noticed it.

I should have kept walking, but something made me look more carefully, squinting at Prescott's brick facade.

There. A figure moving along the building's side, staying close to the wall, heading toward a ground-floor window.

My first thought was that someone was breaking in. My second thought—I should alert security. My third thought, arriving as the figure reached the window with practiced ease, was recognition.

Owen Riley.

I watched, frozen, as Owen boosted himself through the window with ease that spoke of frequent practice. This wasn't his first time. He'd memorized every detail—where to grip, how to distribute weight, exactly how much force the window required.

He was breaking curfew. Coming back from somewhere off campus. And I was watching him do it.

I should report this.

The thought came automatically—three years as student council VP, built on following rules and maintaining standards. There were protocols. Find faculty, report what I'd seen. Owen would face the disciplinary committee. The system would handle it.

My feet didn't move.

I stood there on the pathway, my planner clutched against my chest, watching Owen disappear through the window. He was inside now, probably heading to his room, probably thinking he'd gotten away with it. Again.

And I was complicit in that, wasn't I? By not reporting what I'd seen? By standing here doing nothing when I knew exactly what the rules required?

The rules are there for a reason. Curfew keeps students safe, maintains order. Owen breaking them violates the standards that make Fairmont function.

But another voice, quieter: What harm is he actually doing? A seventeen-year-old senior going for runs. Is that dangerous? Or just against the rules?

I shook my head. Since when did I question whether rules made sense? My job was to uphold them, not debate their merit.

I started walking again, faster now, aware that I'd lost time standing here. The pathway curved around the chapel, and I was just approaching the turn when I heard voices.

"—should have finished the rounds on the east side already," someone was saying. Mr. Hartwell's voice, I recognized it immediately. "Let's check the perimeter near the dorms before we sign off."

Faculty patrol.

They were close, maybe thirty seconds from rounding the corner. And when they did, they'd have a clear view of Prescott Hall and the window Owen had just climbed through. The window that was probably still open, or closing, obvious evidence of a curfew violation if anyone bothered to look.

I should keep walking. Should go to my dorm, let the faculty patrol do their job, let the system work exactly as it was designed to work.

My body moved before my mind approved.

I turned sharply, walking quickly back the way I'd come, back toward Prescott Hall. I had no plan, no clear thought beyond a sudden urgent need to— what? Warn Owen? Protect him? This made no sense. I barely knew him. We'd had one brief, uncomfortable conversation this afternoon. He'd called me one of Ashford's perfect soldiers, which was both accurate and insulting.

But I kept walking, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

Owen emerged from Prescott's main entrance just as I reached the building. He looked relaxed, casual, his tie draped around his neck and his blazer unbuttoned. Like he'd just been inside studying, not sneaking back onto campus after breaking curfew.

He saw me and stopped, surprise flickering across his face.

"Charlotte Pierce," he said, and I heard the question in his voice. What are you doing here?

Behind me, the faculty voices were getting closer. Maybe twenty seconds now. Maybe less.

"Owen," I said, too loudly, walking toward him with what I hoped looked like casual purpose. "There you are. I've been looking for you."

His eyebrows rose slightly, but he recovered quickly. "You have?"

"The history assignment." The lie came smoothly, easily, and some distant part of me was shocked by how natural it felt. "Mr. Hartwell said you had the reading list for next week's debate. I checked the library but it wasn't posted yet."

"Right," Owen said slowly, watching me carefully. "The reading list."

I heard footsteps on the brick pathway. Very close now.

"I know it's almost curfew," I continued, speaking quickly, "but I wanted to get a head start on the research. You know how I am about being prepared."

Mr. Hartwell and another teacher—Ms. Rodriguez from the English department—rounded the corner just as I finished speaking. They both wore the slightly weary expressions of faculty members completing their nightly rounds, ready to finish their checks and go home.

"Ms. Pierce," Mr. Hartwell said, surprise evident in his voice. "Mr. Riley. Cutting it a bit close, aren't we?"

I glanced at my watch in what I hoped looked like startled realization. "Oh! I didn't realize it was already 9:53. I'm sorry, Mr. Hartwell. I was just getting information about next week's assignment and lost track of time."

Mr. Hartwell looked from me to Owen, and I could see him trying to reconcile what he was seeing. Charlotte Pierce, perfect student, standing outside the boys' dorm four minutes before curfew with Owen Riley, Fairmont's most consistent rule-questioner.

"The history debate assignment," Owen supplied, his voice carrying just the right note of helpful clarification. "Charlotte asked about the reading list earlier, and I forgot to mention I had a copy. I told her I'd catch her before curfew to share it."

It was a good addition to the lie, specific and believable. Mr. Hartwell's expression shifted slightly, moving from suspicion toward acceptance.

"I see," he said. "Well, Ms. Pierce, you should head to your dorm immediately. You have—" he checked his watch, "—six minutes."

"Yes, sir. I'm going now." I turned to Owen, maintaining the performance. "Thanks for the reading list. I'll make copies for anyone else who needs them."

"No problem," Owen said, and I thought I detected the smallest hint of amusement in his voice.

I walked away quickly, moving fast enough to show I was taking Mr. Hartwell's directive seriously. Behind me, Ms. Rodriguez said something to Owen about getting inside, then their voices faded.

My hands were shaking.

I noticed as I walked, my fingers trembling around my planner. I'd just lied to a teacher. Smoothly, convincingly, without hesitation. Had covered for someone breaking curfew, actively helped him avoid consequences.

This wasn't who I was.

Except I'd just done it.

The pathway to Whitmore Hall seemed longer, or maybe I was just hyperaware of every step, still processing what had happened. The ten o'clock bell would ring in four minutes. I'd make it back with time to spare. No one would know I'd deviated from my route. No one except Owen and me.

And Mr. Hartwell, if he thought too carefully about finding us together outside Prescott Hall so close to curfew.

But Mr. Hartwell trusted me. That was the thing about a perfect record—people believed you. When Charlotte Pierce said she'd been getting information about an assignment, they accepted it because Charlotte Pierce didn't lie.

Until tonight.

I reached Whitmore Hall with three minutes to spare, my usual cushion of safety somehow intact despite everything. The common room was full of girls finishing last-minute conversations before curfew, the usual evening ritual. Someone was making tea in the corner. Someone else was braiding a friend's hair. Normal. Everything was completely normal.

I climbed the stairs to the third floor, to the room I shared with Sarah. She was already there, changing into pajamas, her work-study shift in the dining hall finished for the night.

"Hey," she said, glancing up. "You're back late."

"Library," I managed. "Lost track of time."

It was technically true. I had been at the library. I just hadn't come straight back.

Sarah returned to changing, and I set my planner on my desk with hands that had finally stopped shaking. Through our window, I could see the quad, could trace the path I'd just walked. If I looked carefully, I could probably see Prescott Hall and the window Owen had climbed through.

I turned away from the window.

Somewhere in the building, I heard the ten o'clock bell begin its count. One, two, three. I'd made it. Back before curfew, same as always, same as every night for three years.

Except tonight I'd broken something more fundamental than curfew. I'd broken my own rules, the internal structure I'd built my entire identity around.

And the worst part—the part I couldn't quite process—was that I didn't regret it.

"You okay?" Sarah asked. "You look weird."

"I'm fine," I said automatically. "Just tired."

Ten chimes. Curfew. Another day complete.

I changed into pajamas, went through my nightly routine, climbed into bed. Sarah turned off the lights, and darkness filled the room.

I lay there staring at the ceiling, listening to Sarah's breathing slow into sleep, trying to understand what I'd just done and why.

And trying not to think about the small, fierce satisfaction I'd felt watching Owen's surprised expression when I'd lied for him. Like I'd done something that mattered, something real, instead of just executing another item on my color-coded schedule.

My perfect record wasn't quite so perfect anymore.

The thought should have terrified me.

Instead, I felt strangely, impossibly awake.
