# Chapter 8: The Bell Tower

Owen was waiting.

I saw him as soon as I rounded the chapel corner—a silhouette against brick, completely comfortable in darkness. When he saw me, he straightened and smiled.

"You came," he said quietly.

"I said I would."

"People say a lot of things." He gestured toward shadows along the chapel's eastern wall. "But you actually showed up. That takes courage."

"Or stupidity."

"Maybe both." Owen started moving, staying close to the building. I fell into step beside him. "Faculty patrol just finished this section. Twenty minutes before they loop back."

"You've really memorized their schedule?"

"After two years of midnight runs, you learn the patterns." He led me around the chapel's corner, to a door I'd never noticed before—plain metal, the kind that looked like it should be locked. "Most of Fairmont's security is psychological. They assume students won't break rules because they're not supposed to, not because it's actually that difficult."

He pulled the door open. It wasn't locked.

"How did you—"

"Maintenance uses this entrance. They're supposed to lock it after evening rounds, but..." Owen shrugged. "People get lazy. Patterns become routine. You stop questioning whether the door actually needs to be locked when nothing bad has happened."

We slipped inside, and Owen closed the door. Sudden darkness. I heard movement, then a flashlight clicked on, casting a narrow beam across a cramped landing and spiral staircase leading up.

"This way," Owen whispered.

I followed, one hand on cold metal railing, heart pounding. The stairs wound upward in tight spirals. I counted steps—twenty, thirty, forty—then Owen stopped.

Another door. Owen jiggled the handle in a specific way until something clicked and it swung open.

Cold air hit my face, carrying salt smell of the Atlantic. We stepped onto a narrow observation platform encircling the bell tower's upper level, and suddenly I could see everything.

Fairmont spread below like a miniature model. The quad, academic buildings, dormitories with lit windows. Beyond it all, the dark Atlantic Ocean, endless and indifferent to prep school rules.

"Oh," I breathed.

Owen turned off his flashlight. "Better than your planner?"

I couldn't answer. I'd spent three years at Fairmont, knew every building and pathway. But I'd never seen it like this—small and contained, one tiny ordered space in a vast dark world.

"The first time I came up here," Owen said, leaning against the railing beside me, "I'd had the worst day. Failed a chemistry test, got into an argument with my roommate, received an email from my parents about disappointing them. I felt like Fairmont was this crushing weight, these expectations I couldn't meet." He gestured at the campus below. "But from up here, it all looked so small. Manageable. Like maybe the pressure was just... perspective."

I stared at the dormitories. Somewhere in Whitmore Hall, Sarah was sleeping in our room, assuming I was in bed right beside her. Somewhere in the administrative building, my spotless disciplinary record sat in a file, proof that Charlotte Pierce always followed rules.

"It feels different," I said quietly. "Being out here when I'm not supposed to be. Like I'm seeing it clearly for the first time."

"That's because you're making your own choice about where to be and when." Owen turned to face me. "Every other time you've moved through campus, you've been following a schedule, fulfilling an expectation, going where you're supposed to go. But right now, you're here because you chose it."

"I chose to break curfew and risk my record."

"You chose to see something new. The rule-breaking is just a side effect." He was quiet for a moment. "Can I ask you something?"

"Okay."

"Why do you care so much about being perfect?"

The question should have made me defensive. But something about the darkness, the height, the strange intimacy of this shared secret made honesty feel easier than deflection.

"Because I'm good at it," I said. "My brother was perfect at Fairmont, then Yale. My parents show love through expectations. Disappointing them would mean..." I trailed off. "It would mean I'm not who they think I am."

"And who do they think you are?"

"Someone who succeeds. Someone who makes them proud."

"Okay, but who are you?" Owen asked gently. "When you're not performing? When you're just Charlotte, not Charlotte Pierce the perfect student—who is that person?"

I'd been asked variations of this before. Mrs. Peterson asking what made me distinctive. Sarah asking what I wanted. But no one had asked quite so directly: Who are you?

"I don't know," I admitted. "I've spent so long being what everyone expected that I'm not sure there's anything underneath. What if I take away the achievements and perfect record and there's just... nothing?"

Owen was quiet. When he spoke, his voice was thoughtful.

"I don't think that's true. Tuesday night, when you covered for me—that wasn't about meeting expectations. That was you making a choice that contradicted everything you'd been taught to value. Which means there's a Charlotte underneath all the performance, one with her own judgment and instincts." He paused. "She just hasn't had much practice making decisions."

A breeze picked up, carrying the ocean's cold salt smell, and I shivered. Owen immediately shrugged off his jacket and offered it.

"I'm fine," I said automatically.

"Charlotte." He held the jacket out. "It's not a test. You're cold, I have a jacket. You're allowed to accept help."

I took the jacket, and it was warm from his body heat, smelling like soap and something woodsy. I pulled it on, and Owen smiled.

"See? Choice. You wanted the jacket, I offered it, you took it. No color-coding required."

"It's not the same as major life decisions."

"Actually, it's exactly the same. Just smaller scale." Owen gestured at campus below. "Every day is full of tiny choices. Most people make them automatically, based on habit. But you could choose differently. Sit at a different lunch table, spend free time on something that interests you rather than something that looks good on applications."

"But those choices have consequences."

"All choices have consequences. Following the path laid out for you has consequences too—you end up at Wellesley studying pre-law because your mother did, not because you want to." Owen's voice was gentle. "The question is whether you're willing to live with consequences of your own choices versus everyone else's."

I thought about my early decision application waiting to be mailed. My thesis on a topic I didn't care about. My entire four-year plan, mapped out before I'd arrived.

"What if I make the wrong choices?"

"Then you adjust. Make different ones. Choices aren't permanent unless you let them be." Owen leaned back against the railing. "The only irreversible choice is never making choices at all—just following the script until you wake up at forty living someone else's life."

The clock in the tower behind us showed 12:15. An hour past curfew. An hour into my first deliberate rule violation.

I should have felt guilty, anxious, worried about consequences. Instead, I felt clear-headed. Awake. More myself than I'd been in years.

"Thank you," I said.

"For what?"

"For this. For showing me this perspective." I gestured at the view. "For asking questions I needed to be asked."

"You're welcome." Owen checked his watch. "We should probably head back soon. Faculty patrol will loop through again around 12:45."

We started back down the spiral stairs, Owen's flashlight leading the way. The narrow space felt different now—less frightening, more like adventure I was choosing.

At the bottom, Owen cracked the door open, checking the coast was clear. Campus was silent, dark except for scattered lights.

"Okay," he whispered. "Quick and quiet to the quad, then you go east to Whitmore, I'll go west to Prescott. If anyone sees you, you were studying in the library and lost track of time."

"What about you?"

"I'll be fine. I've been doing this for two years." He smiled. "Ready?"

I nodded.

We slipped out and moved quickly across campus, staying in shadows. My heart pounded, but it was excitement now, not fear. We reached the quad, and Owen stopped.

"Fire escape should still be accessible," he said quietly. "Just take your time climbing up, test each step before putting your weight on it."

"I will."

We stood there for a moment, neither of us moving. In the darkness, Owen's face was hard to read, but his expression was soft.

"You did well tonight," he said. "For your first midnight adventure."

"First?" I echoed.

"Well." Owen's smile was visible even in the dim light. "Unless you want this to be the only time you see what exists outside your schedule."

He was giving me an out. One night, like I'd insisted. We could part now, go back to our separate worlds—him the calculated rebel, me the perfect student—and pretend this had been a one-time anomaly.

"Maybe not the only time," I heard myself say.

"No?"

"I mean... you're right. About perspective. About choices." I pulled his jacket tighter around me, then realized I was still wearing it. "Oh, your jacket—"

"Keep it for now. Return it Monday." Owen started backing toward his dorm. "Same time next week?"

"That's insane."

"Probably," he said, using his favorite word. "But you'll come anyway."

He turned and jogged toward Prescott Hall, disappearing into shadows before I could respond.

I stood alone in the quad, wearing Owen's jacket, an hour past curfew, smiling.

Then I climbed back up the fire escape, slipped through the common room window, and made my way silently to my room.

Sarah hadn't moved. I changed into pajamas, hid Owen's jacket in my closet, and climbed into bed.

Through the window, the bell tower rose against the night sky, its clock showing 12:52.

I'd been out nearly two hours. Broken curfew deliberately, climbed a supposedly locked tower, talked about life and choices and who I actually was.

And I hadn't gotten caught.

More than that—I'd felt more like myself than I had in three years.

I closed my eyes, but sleep was impossible. My mind replayed the evening—Owen waiting in darkness, the spiral stairs, the view from the tower, his questions I couldn't answer.

Same time next week?

I should say no. One midnight adventure was risky enough.

But I was already thinking about next Friday. Already wondering what else Owen would show me. Already wanting that same clarity I'd felt on the observation deck, seeing Fairmont small and manageable beneath me.

I pulled my planner from my desk, opened it to next Friday, and made the smallest mark at 11:00 PM. Just a dot. Nothing Sarah would notice.

But I would know.

A choice that was mine.

The thought made me smile in the darkness.
